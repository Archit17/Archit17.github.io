    <p> Chandigarh is a city located in North India, very near the lower foothills of the Himalayas. It is situated about
      250 km north of New Delhi, the capital, and has a population of around 1.2 million. (This is India, after all!!!). The open
      hand (picture above) is the emblem of the Government of Chandigarh.

    <p> Chandigarh is a planned city designed by French architect Le Corbusier in 1960 and follows a gridlike urban planning system. This sometimes 
      can be quite in contrast to the rest of India. ^^
